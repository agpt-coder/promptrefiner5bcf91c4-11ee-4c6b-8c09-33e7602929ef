# PromptRefiner

To develop the specified API endpoint that refines string LLM prompts with GPT4, we will leverage the outlined tech stack: Python, FastAPI for creating the API, PostgreSQL as our database, and Prisma for object relational mapping. The API will expose a single endpoint which accepts string inputs, representing the LLM prompts that need refining. The core functionality involves using the OpenAI Python package to communicate with the GPT4 model, sending the user's prompt for refinement based on advanced prompt engineering techniques discussed earlier, such as iterative refinement, prompt chaining, and personalized construction.

Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of the steps to implement this functionality:

1. **API Design and Setup**: Using FastAPI, design an endpoint that accepts a POST request with a JSON body containing the 'prompt' key. FastAPI's asynchronous support ensures efficient handling of requests, especially crucial for AI-based processing which might have varied execution times.

2. **OpenAI Integration**: With the OpenAI Python package, integrate the GPT4 model by configuring the necessary authentication to access OpenAI's API services. This allows the application to send prompts to GPT4 for refinement.

3. **Prompt Refinement Logic**: Implement the logic for refining prompts as per the system message guidance. This involves creating a function that wraps around the GPT4 interaction, making use of the advanced techniques for prompt engineering to refine and enhance the original user prompt.

4. **Database Integration**: Utilize PostgreSQL and Prisma for managing any data persistence needs. While the prompt refinement might not inherently require database storage, logging, or configuration settings, such as rate limiting or API keys, might be beneficially managed through a database.

5. **Response Handling**: Ensure that the refined prompts are returned to the user in a structured format, likely JSON, detailing any changes or improvements made.

6. **Error Handling and Validation**: Robust error handling to gracefully manage failed interactions with GPT4, validation to ensure prompts are appropriately formatted and prevent misuse of the API.

7. **Testing and Deployment**: Extensive testing to ensure the API behaves as expected under various conditions followed by deployment, possibly considering cloud functions for scalability and cost-effectiveness.

This process encapsulates the creation of an API that not only leverages the power of GPT4 to refine LLM prompts but does so with efficiency and reliability, thanks to the FastAPI framework and the structured approach to prompt engineering.

## What you'll need to run this
* An unzipper (usually shipped with your OS)
* A text editor
* A terminal
* Docker
  > Docker is only needed to run a Postgres database. If you want to connect to your own
  > Postgres instance, you may not have to follow the steps below to the letter.


## How to run 'PromptRefiner'

1. Unpack the ZIP file containing this package

2. Adjust the values in `.env` as you see fit.

3. Open a terminal in the folder containing this README and run the following commands:

    1. `poetry install` - install dependencies for the app

    2. `docker-compose up -d` - start the postgres database

    3. `prisma generate` - generate the database client for the app

    4. `prisma db push` - set up the database schema, creating the necessary tables etc.

4. Run `uvicorn project.server:app --reload` to start the app

## How to deploy on your own GCP account
1. Set up a GCP account
2. Create secrets: GCP_EMAIL (service account email), GCP_CREDENTIALS (service account key), GCP_PROJECT, GCP_APPLICATION (app name)
3. Ensure service account has following permissions: 
    Cloud Build Editor
    Cloud Build Service Account
    Cloud Run Developer
    Service Account User
    Service Usage Consumer
    Storage Object Viewer
4. Remove on: workflow, uncomment on: push (lines 2-6)
5. Push to master branch to trigger workflow
